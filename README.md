To assist in the development and refinement of this web page, I utilized AI tools to enhance productivity and accuracy in both the html and p5.js code. ChatGPT provided real-time assistance, helping to refine the logic, troubleshoot issues, and ensure semantic correctness in the code structure. Meanwhile, GitHub Copilot served as a helpful coding partner, suggesting completions and snippets based on context, which greatly accelerated the development process. These AI-powered tools have proven invaluable, not only in speeding up development but also in improving the quality of the code, making it more robust and maintainable.
